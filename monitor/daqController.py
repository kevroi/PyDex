Acquire data from the NI USB-6211 DAQ.
A GUI displays the data as it's acquired, and collects statistics
from multiple traces.
More information on the DAQ is available at:
https://documentation.help/NI-DAQmx-Key-Concepts/documentation.pdf
We use the python module: https://nidaqmx-python.readthedocs.io
